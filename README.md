## JavaScript

```JS
// Respond to the user clicking an element
var btn = document.getElementById("theButton");
btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Do some stuff
});

// Select random element from an array
function getRandom(array) {
  var selection = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
  return array[selection];
}

// Use document.querySelectorAll() to select multiple elements
// using a CSS selector
var allGreenElem = document.querySelectorAll('.green');

// This gives you an array-like object you can loop through
for (var i = 0; i < allGreenElem.length; i++) {
  // do something with allGreenElem[i]
}
```
